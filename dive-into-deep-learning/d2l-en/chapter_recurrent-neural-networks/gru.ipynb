    "# Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we discussed how gradients are calculated in a recurrent neural network. In particular we found that long products of matrices can lead to vanishing or divergent gradients. Let's briefly think about what such gradient anomalies mean in practice: \n",
    "\n",
    "* We might encounter a situation where an early observation is highly significant for predicting all future observations. Consider the somewhat contrived case where the first observation contains a checksum and the goal is to discern whether the checksum is correct at the end of the sequence. In this case the influence of the first token is vital. We would like to have some mechanism for storing vital early information in a *memory cell*. Without such a mechanism we will have to assign a very large gradient to this observation, since it affects all subsequent observations. \n",
    "* We might encounter situations where some symbols carry no pertinent observation. For instance, when parsing a webpage there might be auxiliary HTML code that is irrelevant for the purpose of assessing the sentiment conveyed on the page. We would like to have some mechanism for *skipping such symbols* in the latent state representation.\n",
    "* We might encounter situations where there is a logical break between parts of a sequence. For instance there might be a transition between chapters in a book, a transition between a bear and a bull market for securities, etc.; In this case it would be nice to have a means of *resetting* our internal state representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of methods have been proposed to address this. One of the earliest is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) of [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1215-lstm-can-solve-hard-long-time-lag-problems.pdf) which we will discuss in a [later section](../chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/lstm.md). The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) of [Cho et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259) is a slightly more streamlined variant that often offers comparable performance and is significantly faster to compute. See also [Chung et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555) for more details. Due to its simplicity we start with the GRU. \n",

    "## Gating the Hidden State\n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinction between regular RNNs and GRUs is that the latter support gating of the hidden state. This means that we have dedicated mechanisms for when the hidden state should be updated and also when it should be reset. These mechanisms are learned and they address the concerns listed above. For instance, if the first symbol is of great importance we will learn not to update the hidden state after the first observation. Likewise, we will learn to skip irrelevant temporary observations. Lastly, we will learn to reset the latent state whenever needed. We discuss this in detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset Gates and Update Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to introduce are reset and update gates. We engineer them to be vectors with entries in $(0,1)$ such that we can perform convex combinations, e.g.\\ of a hidden state and an alternative. For instance, a reset variable would allow us to control how much of the previous state we might still want to remember. Likewise, an update variable would allow us to control how much of the new state is just a copy of the old state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by engineering gates to generate these variables. The figure below illustrates the inputs for both reset and update gates in a GRU, given the current time step input $\\mathbf{X}_t$ and the hidden state of the previous time step $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$. The output is given by a fully connected layer with a sigmoid as its activation function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![ Reset and update gate in a GRU. ](../img/gru_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume there are $h$ hidden units and, for a given time step $t$, the mini-batch input is $\\mathbf{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ (number of examples: $n$, number of inputs: $d$ï¼‰and the hidden state of the last time step is $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$. Then, the reset gate $\\mathbf{R}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ and update gate $\\mathbf{Z}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ are computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mathbf{R}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xr} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hr} + \\mathbf{b}_r)\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{W}_{xr}, \\mathbf{W}_{xz} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{hr}, \\mathbf{W}_{hz} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ are weight parameters and $\\mathbf{b}_r, \\mathbf{b}_z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$ are biases. We use a sigmoid function (see e.g. the [MLP](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/mlp.md) section for a description) to transform values to the interval $(0,1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset Gate in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by integrating the reset gate with a regular latent state updating mechanism. In a conventional deep RNN we would have an update of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}_t = \\tanh(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1}\\mathbf{W}_{hh} + \\mathbf{b}_h).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially identical to the discussion of the previous section, albeit with a nonlinearity in the form of $\\tanh$ to ensure that the values of the hidden state remain in the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n",
    "If we want to be able to reduce the influence of previous states we can multiply $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ with $\\mathbf{R}_t$ elementwise. Whenever the entries in $\\mathbf{R}_t$ are close to $1$ we recover a conventional deep RNN. For all entries of $\\mathbf{R}_t$ that are close to $0$ the hidden state is the result of an MLP with $\\mathbf{X}_t$ as input. Any pre-existing hidden state is thus 'reset' to defaults. This leads to the following candidate for a new hidden state (it is a *candidate* since we still need to incorporate the action of the update gate).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}_t = \\tanh(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \\left(\\mathbf{R}_t \\odot \\mathbf{H}_{t-1}\\right) \\mathbf{W}_{hh} + \\mathbf{b}_h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates the computational flow after applying the reset gate. The symbol $\\odot$ indicates pointwise multiplication between tensors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![ Candidate hidden state computation in a GRU. The multiplication is carried out elementwise. ](../img/gru_2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Gate in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to incorporate the effect of the update gate. This determines the extent to which the new state $\\mathbf{H}_t$ is just the old state $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ and by how much the new candidate state $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}_t$ is used. The gating variable $\\mathbf{Z}_t$ can be used for this purpose, simply by taking elementwise convex combinations between both candidates. This leads to the final update equation for the GRU. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}_t = \\mathbf{Z}_t \\odot \\mathbf{H}_{t-1}  + (1 - \\mathbf{Z}_t) \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Hidden state computation in a GRU. As before, the multiplication is carried out elementwise. ](../img/gru_3.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the update gate is close to $1$ we simply retain the old state. In this case the information from $\\mathbf{X}_t$ is essentially ignored, effectively skipping time step $t$ in the dependency chain. Whenever it is close to $1$ the new latent state $\\mathbf{H}_t$ approaches the candidate latent state $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}_t$. These designs can help cope with the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs and better capture dependencies for time series with large time step distances. In summary GRUs have the following two distinguishing features:\n",
